Testing Mailto Links & Sharing
==============================

Mailto links
------------

Just click on all of these links and check if the result is the expected one:

* [Just an email address](mailto:abc@example.org) - should open a chat with `abc@example.org` (and maybe ask whether a chat should be created if it does not exist already)
* [email address with subject](mailto:abc@example.org?subject=testing%20mailto%20uris) - should open a chat with `abc@example.org` and fill `testing mailto uris`; as we created the chat in the previous step, it should not ask `Chat with â€¦` but directly open the chat
* [email address with body](mailto:abc@example.org?body=this%20is%20a%20test) - should open a chat with `abc@example.org`, draft `this is a test`
* [email address with subject and body](mailto:abc@example.org?subject=testing%20mailto%20uris&body=this%20is%20a%20test) - should open a chat with `abc@example.org`, draft `testing mailto uris` \<newline\> `this is a test`
* [HTML encoding](mailto:%20info@example.org) - should open a chat with `info@example.org`
* [more HTML encoding](mailto:simplebot@example.org?body=!web%20https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2Flite%3Fq%3Dduck%2520it) - should open a chat with `simplebot@example.org`, draft `!web https://duckduckgo.com/lite?q=duck%20it`
* [no email, just subject&body](mailto:?subject=bla&body=blub) - this should let you choose a chat and create a draft `bla` \<newline\> `blub` there

### Regression test for the issue fixed by [#1770](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/pull/1770)

- Open Saved Messages chat (could be any other chat too)
- Go to another app and share some text to DC
- In DC select Saved Messages. Edit the shared text if you like (but don't put too much effort in it as the draft will vanish :) ). _Don't_ hit the Send button.
- Leave DC
- Open DC again from the "Recent apps"
- Check that your draft is still there

### Regression test for [issue 2032](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/2032)

- Share an image from another app to Delta Chat
- Select a chat
- Tap on the pen to edit the image
- edit the image and hit confirm
- Check that your edit is still there
