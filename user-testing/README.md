# Testing Checklist

## Testing individual features

[mailto links (mainly for Android currently)](./mailto-links.md)

## Preparation

**Alice** will be the tester. You need 
- an E-Mail address 
- and the release candidate build
- a Thunderbird installation with Enigmail or TB-AC.

**Bob** is the "sparring partner" of Alice. Can be a daily-use Delta Chat
Desktop account. You need
- an E-Mail address
- Delta Chat Desktop version >= 0.840.0

**Charlie** is the second account of Alice. The Charlie points are cool if you
have the time and a third E-Mail address for testing. If it's too much of a
hassle, don't worry about it and leave out those points.

## Tests

    - [ ] Does it arrive?

    - [ ] Alice sends an Autocrypt Setup Message from another client: can Alice import it in Android?
- Disable: Settings -> Advanced -> Prefer end-to-end encryption
    - [ ] If you send out a mail afterwards, does it contain an "Autocrypt: prefer-encrypt=nopreference; " header?
- Enable: Settings -> Advanced -> Prefer end-to-end encryption
    - [ ] If you send out a mail afterwards, does it contain the "Autocrypt: prefer-encrypt=mutual; " header again?
- Backup & Restore
    - [ ] Export Backup: Settings -> Chats & Media -> Backup

- [ ] Bob writes a message to Charlie
    - [ ] Charlie finds the message in their Contact requests
    - [ ] Charlie clicks "Not Now" to not open a chat.
    - [ ] Bob sends another message to Charlie
    - [ ] Charlie finds the message in her Contact request and clicks "Never" this time
    - [ ] Bob sends Charlie another message, but Charlie doesn't receive it
- [ ] Alice archives her Chat with Bob; she doesn't see it anymore
- [ ] Bob writes her a mail, Alice receives it nonetheless, the chat is unarchived automatically

### Out of scope

Creating verified groups is out of scope for a community tester, until the
Desktop client can join verified groups.

Things which are already tested by automated tests, and don't have any UI,
don't need testing.
